**Explanation of the Model:**

*   **LNHR Promotion:** The introduction of the Late Night Happy Hour (LNHR) on April 1, 2013, is the exogenous variable in this model. Its presence (after the implementation date) is expected to influence several other variables.

*   **Total Revenue of the Bar:** This is a key endogenous variable. The theory posits that the LNHR promotion will have a **positive direct effect (β1 +)** on the total revenue [8-12]. This is supported by observations of increased revenue after the promotion was introduced [8-12, 16].

*   **Customer Traffic & Sales Volume in T3:** The 50% discount during the 11 PM to midnight slot (T3) is expected to lead to a **positive direct effect (β2 +)** on customer traffic and sales volume during that hour [8-13, 16, 17]. This increased activity in T3 is a primary goal of the promotion [14, 27, 28].

*   **Revenue in T1:** The theory suggests a **positive direct effect (β3 +)** of the LNHR promotion on revenue in the 9 PM to 10 PM time slot (T1) [9-11, 16, 20]. This indicates a potential "spillover" effect where customers arrive earlier to take advantage of the overall bar atmosphere or in anticipation of the later discounts [29].

*   **Revenue in T2:** The model includes a **negative direct effect (β4 -)** of the LNHR promotion on revenue in the 10 PM to 11 PM time slot (T2) [19, 21-23]. This accounts for the anticipated delay of purchases by patrons waiting for the happy hour discounts in T3. Some analysis suggests no significant increase in T2 revenue post-LNHR [9, 22, 23].

*   **Day of the Week:** This variable is proposed as a **moderator** of the relationship between the LNHR promotion and total revenue [8, 16, 24, 25]. The effectiveness of the happy hour in increasing revenue is not expected to be uniform across all days [8, 9, 16].

*   **Slower Days:** This is a specific aspect of the 'Day of the Week' moderator. The theory suggests that the LNHR promotion will have a **more pronounced positive impact** on revenue on days that are typically slower [8-11, 14, 16, 26]. This implies a stronger positive interaction effect on these days.

*   **Overall Profit:** This is the ultimate outcome of interest. The theory states that the increase in sales due to the LNHR will be sufficient to offset the reduced profit margin from the 50% discount, resulting in an **overall increase in profit (β7 +)** [7, 13-15]. This will depend on the balance between increased volume and the discounted price, as well as other factors like labor costs [15, 26]. The increased customer traffic in T3 (mediated by LNHR) is also expected to contribute positively to profit, though this effect is moderated by the 50% discount **(β8 +)** [7, 15, 18, 19].

*   **Seasonality:** This is included as a potential **confounding variable** that could influence total revenue [1-7]. The theory posits that the observed increases are **primarily attributable to the promotion** and not just seasonal variations. Therefore, ideally, the effect of LNHR should remain significant even after accounting for seasonality. Some reports suggest that the lack of a notable increase in T2 revenue after LNHR introduction might be evidence against seasonality being the sole driver of increased total revenue [19, 22, 23].

*   **Persistence of Effects:** The theory suggests that the positive effects **directly attributable to the happy hour promotion** (like increased traffic during T3) are expected to persist [16, 17]. However, spillover effects (like increased T1 revenue) might be more transient [16, 30].

**Important Considerations for Empirical Testing:**

*   To test this model, you would need time-series data on revenue for T1, T2, and T3, as well as potentially data on customer counts or sales volume, and a measure of seasonality (e.g., monthly indicators).
*   SEM software would be used to estimate the path coefficients (β values) and assess the model fit to the data.
*   Interaction terms would need to be included in the statistical model to test the moderating effects of the day of the week.
*   Profit would likely need to be calculated based on revenue data and information about costs (e.g., cost of goods sold, labor costs) [15, 26, 31].
*   Analyzing data over a longer period would be beneficial to more definitively assess the persistence of the LNHR's effects and to better account for seasonality [4, 7, 17, 32].

This conceptual SEM provides a framework for understanding the hypothesized relationships between the LNHR promotion and various outcomes based on your observations and the insights from the provided sources. Empirical analysis would be required to validate these relationships and the overall model.
